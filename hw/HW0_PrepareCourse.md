# HW0: Prepare for the Course

## Software to Install

In this section is software used for class. You do not have to install all the different options provided, but the more the better.
If you have a Mac, Vivado will not install, so you will have to use

1. Install the following software:
   - Xilinx Vivado (Windows, Linux) If you have a Mac, you will have to use the vlab (ECE105) and learn to login. Note, you can use the vlab remotely. You will have to create an account.
   - [Instructions on Installing Vivado]()
   - [Instructions on using the vlab](https://vlab.rutgers.edu/)
      Note that vlab gives you a computer to use, but when you log out your storage is gone. So you must write your results to a memory stick if you are in person, or email to yourself. This is inconvenient, so if at all possible I recommend installing on your computer.
1. Install Icarus Verilog. This works on Windows, MacOS (with work)
 and Linux.
   - [Icarus Verilog on MacOS](https://ee.sonoma.edu/current-students/resources/how-install-icarus-and-gtkwave-mac)
   - [Icarus Verilog on Windows](https://bleyer.org/icarus/)
1. Get ready to use a CAD package to draw your circuits. Your choices are:
   - Fritzing, simple, limited, open source
      - [For Windows](https://github.com/RU-ECE/ECE231-DigitalLogicDesign/blob/main/hw/HW0_PrepareCourse.md)
      - [For MacOS](https://rutgers.box.com/s/gvhypglldi0fq2cbpvcahmgwdjzzb417)
   - [Use TinkerCAD, a web-based CAD package, free from Autodesk](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
   - [Circuitlab](https://www.circuitlab.com/), Rutgers pays for a license for all students and faculty
   - [KiCAD (much more sophisticated, open source)[https://www.kicad.org/download/]
1. In order to edit your code, you should have a programming editor.You can use anything you want. You can just edit in vivado, but as you will see in class, I use Icarus verilog which is much faster to get small jobs done. And you should all have vscode for other reasons. So I suggest installing vscode if you have not already done so. You should learn on your own, and then use an AI to help you. Do not let the AI type everything for you. If you do, you may be able to get your homework done without learning anything, but you will fail the test questions.
